# 02 – Multiple Sources

Extends the basic project with several translation units:

- `target_sources` keeps `CMakeLists.txt` concise while scaling to more files
- the executable depends only on private sources; no libraries yet
- include directories declared with `target_include_directories`

```sh
./build.sh
```
